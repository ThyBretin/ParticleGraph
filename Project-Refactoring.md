## Refactoring
- **addSubParticle.py** and **addAllSubParticle.py**:  has to merge to make a unified function. It should be named : addParticle" 

- **createParticle.py** and **createCodebaseParticle.py**:  has to merge to make a unified function. It should be named : createGraph" 

- **loadGraph.py** and **loadCodebaseGraph.py**:  has to merge to make a unified function. It should be named : loadGraph" 

- **exportGraph.py** and **exportCodebaseGraph.py**:  has to merge to make a unified function. It should be named : exportGraph" 

- **deleteParticle.py** should become **deleteGraph.py** 
- **updateParticle.py** should become **updateGraph.py**

old claude refactoring proposition : 


### 2. Defensive Programming Strategy
- **Input Validation**: Implement validation for all public API functions
- **Type Checking**: Add type annotations and runtime checks for critical code paths
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardize error handling with custom exceptions
- **Graceful Degradation**: Allow partial results when full analysis fails

### 3. Technical Improvements
- **Path Abstraction**: Create a dedicated PathResolver class to handle all path translations
- **Caching Layer**: Implement smarter caching for parsed results
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduce redundant data structures
- **Parallel Processing**: Add option for multi-threaded analysis of large codebases

### 4. Documentation and Testing
- **API Documentation**: Create comprehensive API docs for all public functions
- **Architecture Diagram**: Develop visual representation of system components
- **Test Suite**: Implement thorough unit and integration tests
- **Example Workflows**: Document common usage patterns with examples

### 5. Maintainability Focus
- **Config-Based Approach**: Move hardcoded values to configuration files
- **Plugin Architecture**: Enable extensions for custom analysis needs
- **Versioned API**: Properly version the API for backward compatibility
- **Telemetry**: Add optional usage statistics for error reporting

Implementing these changes would significantly improve robustness, maintainability, and extensibility of the Particle-Graph project, while keeping its core functionality intact.



check_root.py and list_dir.py are declared in Dockerfile and server.py, no imports else where. I think they may be used in the mcp for the user to check if he setup his codebase path correctly.We dicided to keep them until now but I'm not sure if it's worth
