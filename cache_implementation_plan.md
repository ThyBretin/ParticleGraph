# Cache Module Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan for implementing a dedicated cache module for Particle-Graph.

## Current Implementation (Phase 1 Complete)

We have implemented a centralized cache management system for Particle-Graph with the following features:

### CacheManager Class (`src/core/cache_manager.py`)

- Thread-safe operations with reentrant locks
- Both in-memory caching and persistent disk storage
- Cache metadata tracking (access counts, timestamps)
- Automatic persistence with configurable intervals
- Cache invalidation for older entries
- Consistent error handling

### Key Features Implemented

- **Thread Safety**: All cache operations use thread locks to ensure thread safety
- **Automatic Persistence**: Cache entries can be explicitly persisted or automatically synced to disk
- **Cache Statistics**: Tracks metadata about cache usage (access counts, last accessed time)
- **Cache Invalidation**: Support for removing stale cache entries
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for file operations
- **Integration with PathResolver**: Uses PathResolver for all path operations

### API Integration

The following API files have been updated to use the new CacheManager:

- `src/api/load_graph.py`: Uses cache_manager.get() and set() methods
- `src/api/list_graph.py`: Uses cache_manager.keys() to list available graphs
- `src/api/update_graph.py`: Uses cache_manager.set() with persist=True for immediate disk writes
- `src/api/delete_graph.py`: Uses cache_manager.delete() to remove graphs from both memory and disk
- `src/api/create_graph.py`: Uses cache_manager.set() to store newly created graphs

## Phase 2: Future Enhancements

### Step 1: SQLite Implementation

Create a new SQLite-backed version of the cache:
- Implement a `SQLiteCache` class that stores/retrieves from SQLite
- Include schema creation, migration plan, and indexes
- Add support for more complex querying capabilities

### Step 2: Enhanced Caching Features

- Add more sophisticated caching policies (LRU, TTL)
- Implement cache compression for large graph structures
- Add partial graph loading capabilities
- Implement dependency tracking between cached graphs

### Step 3: Cache Analytics and Monitoring

- Add performance monitoring for cache operations
- Implement cache hit/miss statistics
- Create a dashboard for cache performance visualization

## Migration Strategy

1. The migration from the old particle_cache to the new CacheManager is complete
2. All previously affected API files have been updated to use the new system
3. The Dockerfile has been updated to include the new cache_manager.py file

With these changes, we have a more robust and maintainable cache system that provides better error handling, thread safety, and persistence guarantees, setting the foundation for future SQLite integration.
